<h1 id="light-module">Light Module</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>At a high level, the purpose of the project is to develop a method of controlling water flow in response to varying ambient light intensities. The light sensor module is an independent sub-module of this overall system that is responsible for measuring the ambient light intensity and communicating the measured light intensity to the central control module.</p>
<p>The following documents the design process and chosen implementation for this module, and should enable the reader to undertake further development on this module or to use the device in the field.</p>
<h2 id="design">Design</h2>
<p>Our overall design approach followed a modularisation of the solution into three components: the light sensor module that this document describes, the flow module and the central control hub. Specifications drawn up for the central control module in particular placed constraints on the design of this module.</p>
<h3 id="technical-specification">Technical Specification</h3>
<p>A brief technical specification was drawn up to qualify the requirements this sub-module had to meet in order to successfully fulfil its purpose. The following specification is intended to be <strong>solution neutral</strong>, and splits requirements into five groups: functionality, usability, reliability, supportability and performance.</p>

<p>Requirements <em>LM.FR.02</em> and <em>LM.FR.03</em> for example look out of place out of context. Knowing that an Arduino was to be chosen as a microcontroller, this imposed a constraint on the interface between the light sensor module and the control module. An analogue interface was seen to not be robust enough, particularly over the expected separations of around 1 metre. This dictated a digital interface, and the Arduino narrowed the choice to I2C or SPI. It was decided that I2C would be preferred for this module - fewer wires are required and we wouldn&#39;t need the extra speed that SPI affords. I2C clock stretching also provided interesting potential.</p>
<h3 id="brainstorming">Brainstorming</h3>
<p>The central concern when brainstorming and selecting components for this module was the wavelength response. Many digital light sensor chips have low or zero responsivity below 450nm. However, some of the requirements imposed by the above specification making component selection difficult. The devices used have to be robust to drops on power, which isn&#39;t easily quantified from component datasheets. Two or more light sensor devices should be integrated into the board so a comparison can be made on these sorts of metrics.</p>
<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>A circuit schematic and PCB layout were designed to implement the design. <a href="http://kicad-pcb.org/">KiCad</a> was used as an electronics design tool for this implementation, which is open source and is well supported in the Engineering Department, but <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/overview">Autodesk EAGLE</a> would have been equally appropriate. The GitHub repository containing the <a href="http://kicad-pcb.org/">KiCad</a> schematic, PCB layout and Gerber/drill (needed for manufacture) files can be found <a href="https://github.com/valveteam/lighting-module">here</a>.</p>
<p>Additional footprints and components for schematics were created for some of the parts used across our three sub-modules. These will be required to modify the lighting module&#39;s <a href="http://kicad-pcb.org/">KiCad</a> design files; these can be found in our parts library repository <a href="https://github.com/valveteam/parts-library">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="schematic">Schematic</h3>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/valveteam/documentation/master/submodules/light_module_res/light_module_schematic.png" alt="Light Sensor Module - Schematic"></p>
<p>The schematic above shows the circuit design for the light sensor module. There are two different light sensor devices on-board: the <a href="http://www.mouser.com/ds/2/348/bh1750fvi-e-186247.pdf">BH1750</a> and the <a href="http://www.vishay.com/docs/84366/veml6030.pdf">VEML6030</a>. Discussion of the choice of light sensor modules will follow. A terminal block is used to connect the circuit to a DC power supply or solar panel. A 6-pin Molex KK connector provides a header for a wiring loom to interface the central control module and the light sensor module. A 6-pin 2.54mm header was also integrated that matches the pin-out of the Molex header for testing/debugging. Four indicator LEDs are present, two to indicate the presence of power supply voltages and two to indicate the use of one of the light sensor devices&#39; interrupt pins.</p>
<p>This module was designed to be equipped with a <a href="http://www.farnell.com/datasheets/2015812.pdf?_ga=2.223439003.1489813392.1528211098-1797846736.1526464882&amp;_gac=1.92423919.1527093482.CjwKCAjwopTYBRAzEiwAnU4kb2Gudeb7t_QQe6WdS-r1W3v1ksNALiBg8HrnpId2o7Ed5hTxyHYG8RoCJFoQAvD_BwE">STR series</a> switching voltage regulator to regulate the 12V supply to the 3.3V supply required by both light sensor devices. The 3.3V supply can also be provided externally via the Molex header, a flexibility feature that was of great use when supply problems inhibited our ability to source the <a href="http://www.farnell.com/datasheets/2015812.pdf?_ga=2.223439003.1489813392.1528211098-1797846736.1526464882&amp;_gac=1.92423919.1527093482.CjwKCAjwopTYBRAzEiwAnU4kb2Gudeb7t_QQe6WdS-r1W3v1ksNALiBg8HrnpId2o7Ed5hTxyHYG8RoCJFoQAvD_BwE">STR series</a> regulator part. A filter was designed upstream of the switching regulator according to the <a href="http://www.farnell.com/datasheets/2015812.pdf?_ga=2.223439003.1489813392.1528211098-1797846736.1526464882&amp;_gac=1.92423919.1527093482.CjwKCAjwopTYBRAzEiwAnU4kb2Gudeb7t_QQe6WdS-r1W3v1ksNALiBg8HrnpId2o7Ed5hTxyHYG8RoCJFoQAvD_BwE">STR series datasheet</a> to smooth the input supply, which makes that sub-circuit more robust for an eventual solar panel input.</p>

<p>The above diagram shows an annotated copy of the PCB layout, with all the major components discussed in the previous sub-section pointed out. Our LEDs were chosen to be orange for 12V and green for the main 3.3V supply rail; a common standard used across our sub-systems. Yellow and blue were chosen for the status LEDs indicating the use of the interrupt pins for the VEML6030 and BH1750 respectively.</p>

<h3 id="procurement-issues">Procurement Issues</h3>
<p>In the design detailed previously, a voltage regulation circuit based on the <a href="http://www.farnell.com/datasheets/2015812.pdf?_ga=2.223439003.1489813392.1528211098-1797846736.1526464882&amp;_gac=1.92423919.1527093482.CjwKCAjwopTYBRAzEiwAnU4kb2Gudeb7t_QQe6WdS-r1W3v1ksNALiBg8HrnpId2o7Ed5hTxyHYG8RoCJFoQAvD_BwE">STR series</a> switching regulator was included. This switching regulator balances high efficiency with a wide range of voltage inputs suitable for a solar panel as an input voltage source. However, due to availability issues we were unable to source the parts for and assemble this part of the circuit.</p>
<p>In our design process, we made sure to submit the control module PCB for manufacture last, so that we could include any additional small circuits that were needed, not initially recognised and highlighted by unit testing of the light sensor and flow modules. This allowed us to integrate two voltage regulation circuits into the control board, to provide both a 5V and a 3.3V supply rail, using the <a href="http://www.farnell.com/datasheets/1788412.pdf">TR series</a> switching regulator, the through-hole variant of the component originally chosen. The 3.3V supply could then be passed to the light sensor module via the Molex connectors.</p>
<h3 id="light-sensor-devices">Light Sensor Devices</h3>
<h4 id="bh1750">BH1750</h4>
<p>The BH1750 was chosen as one of our light sensor devices as it is reasonably widely available and used, with various breakout boards and tutorials/demonstrations using the chip being available online. Most importantly, the chip is readily available via UK suppliers including Farnell and RS Online. Our software for interacting with the BH1750 was based on a fork of a publicly-available <a href="https://github.com/claws/BH1750">GitHub repository</a> containing an Arduino library for the chip.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/valveteam/documentation/master/submodules/light_module_res/bh1750_als.png" alt="BH1750 ALS Response"></p>
<p>The BH1750 has a single response mode, with the spectral response of the sensor to various wavelengths of light illustrated above. The sensor responds primarily in the 400-700nm range, which roughly matches the wavelength range of the photocatalyst. However, its relative response strength is quite variable within that range, when in reality a more uniform response would potentially be desirable. The response curve is designed to roughly match the human eye, for applications such as dimming mobile device screens or keyboard backlights for battery preservation. However, the photocatalyst&#39;s response does not match the human eye.</p>
<h4 id="veml6030">VEML6030</h4>
<p>The VEML6030 has two different response modes, referred to by the <a href="https://www.vishay.com/docs/84367/designingveml6030.pdf">VEML6030 Application Note</a> as the ambient light sensor (ALS) channel and the white channel. The software for interacting with the VEML6030 was also based on an Arduino library from a fork of a public <a href="https://github.com/NorthernWidget/VEML6030">GitHub repository</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/valveteam/documentation/master/submodules/light_module_res/veml6030_als.png" alt="VEML6030 ALS Response"></p>
<p>The ALS response curve is plotted in the figure above, along with the approximate response curve of the human eye. Note the similar wavelength range and response curve shape to that illustrated in the evaluation of the BH1750.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/valveteam/documentation/master/submodules/light_module_res/veml6030_white.png" alt="VEML6030 ALS Response"></p>
<p>The VEML6030 offers increased flexibility in the sense it offers a second mode, referred to as the white channel. This has a much wider 250-1000nm wavelength range and a much more uniform response in the 350-700nm range required for the application. The shape of the response curve is shown in the above figure.</p>
