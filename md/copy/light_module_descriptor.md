The light module is the primary sensor module in the system. The module has two light sensor devices, the BH1750 and the VEML6030, which are used to measure the ambient light level and report this level back to the control module via an I2C interface. The module is also designed to support on-board voltage regulation if the application demands solar panel voltages to be fed into the sensor module directly.
