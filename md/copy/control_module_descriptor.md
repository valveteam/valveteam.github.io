The control module is the central hub of our solution. The module uses an Arduino Micro and interfaces the microcontroller with the light sensor module, which provides the light level in lux as an input to the control module, and the flow module, to which an output corresponding to the state of the solenoid valve is provided. The correct flow rate response, alongside some debugging features, are therefore provided via this module.
